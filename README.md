I have designed an HR Analytics Dashboard featuring dynamic real-time updates sourced from an HR dataset. This dashboard seamlessly reflects any alterations within the dataset, ensuring up-to-date information. Key metrics showcased include employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, active employees, and average employee age.

Utilizing a combination of pie charts, bar charts, heat maps, and donut charts, this dashboard provides visually compelling representations of the aforementioned metrics. These visualizations offer insightful perspectives on workforce dynamics, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning within HR management.
